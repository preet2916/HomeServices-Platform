Home Services is a PHP-based web application that allows users to book various home services like cleaning, plumbing, and electrical work. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and PHP, the platform runs locally using XAMPP. It includes user registration, service listings, booking functionality, and an admin panel to manage users and services. The project was developed using VS Code and version-controlled with Git and GitHub.
